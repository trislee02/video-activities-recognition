Guide to use the download & cut video tool:

Installation:
- pip install 'TikTokApi==4.1.0'
- pip install playwright
- pip install pytube

- Step 1: Copy folder download_and_cut_video_tool -> this is the folder for you to create new dataset
- Step 2: List all of your videos in the file videolist.txt (both youtube & tiktok videos are good)
E.g https://www.tiktok.com/@sikatako133twins/video/7061826818545814810 1 0:00 1:00 0
- Step 3: run generateDataset.py. This code will download videos listed in videolist.txt & cut them and put into corresponding dataset folder,
then save their information into videos.json (downloaded, cut, file_name). All folders will be generated automatically.
+ Next time you run generateDataset.py, all videos which have been downloaded/cut will be skipped (unless you change the config in videos.json)
- Step 4: use function removeVideo(youtube/tiktok url) in generateDataset.py to remove a video from the dataset and videos.json
- Step 5: list.py -> see the total duration of each class
